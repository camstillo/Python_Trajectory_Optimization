# Trajectory Optimziation with GEKKO 

## Cameron Castillo

### Brief

I this project, I use the GEKKO optimization suite to implement a trajectory optimization program. It uses an Orbital solver class from Alfonso Gonzales's [Orbital Mechanics with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNpnzNKQrNg&list=PLOIRBaljOV8gn074rWFWYP1dCr2dJqWab) series. I will organize the project better in the future, as this includes many of my attempts to learn the GEKKO program and the optimization suite.

### Plans

I have a few ideas about what to do with the project as time goes on:

* Create a GUI for simple use of solver
* Include pertubation from graviational sources
* Include accurate atmospheric drag in calcualtions (goes with pertubations)
* Output expected TLEs of new orbit
* Output the expected minimum fuel usage
* Generate an output that can be fed to the specified thruster for the actual manuever
* Determine mission plans for a satellite with a given thruster

Please let me know if you'd like to add to this list or contribute!
